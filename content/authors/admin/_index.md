I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Notre Dame. I work as a research assistant in the Computer Vision Research Lab with Prof. Kevin Bowyer, Prof. Walter Scheirer and Prof. Patrick Flynn. I graduated from IIIT-Delhi with a B. Tech in Computer Science & Engineering and specialized in Image Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

The focus of my research is on detecting and understanding behavior that is anomalous in the visual world. I study how image manipulations affect recognition and develop approaches that detect and profile those manipulations.
